    "description": "Hi We have introduced a groundbreaking initiative with the establishment of Pakistan Products House, the country’s first-ever international export display centre. Located in South Sudan, this pioneering facility serves as a permanent platform for showcasing products from Gujranwala’s leading industrial sectors, representing Pakistan’s manufacturing strength and innovation on the global stage. The Pakistan Products House has opened new trade corridors in Africa, enabling exporters to connect directly with buyers, distributors, and investors. By offering continuous exposure for industrial products beyond traditional trade fairs, it facilitates long-term business promotion, B2B engagement, and export growth. Building on this success, additional centres are being developed in Uganda, Nigeria and Morocco, further expanding Gujranwala’s international presence and strengthening Pakistan’s footprint in emerging markets.",
